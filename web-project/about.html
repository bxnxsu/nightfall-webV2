        Nightfall is an exciting indie game that features a captivating low-poly
        visual style and a unique gameplay experience. In this game, you'll have
        to test your survival skills against an array of dangerous creatures
        that emerge during the night. As the game progresses, your enemies
        become stronger, but so do you. In order to survive, you must spend your
        days gathering resources, crafting weapons and gear, and fortifying your
        defenses. But your ultimate goal is to defeat Joe, the final boss who
        seeks to vanquish all who oppose him. Throughout the game, you'll face a
        series of challenging bosses that will test your skills and strategy.
        With each victory, you'll gain new abilities and upgrades that will help
        you on your journey to defeat Joe and save the world.
